Real-Time Data Visualization and Interaction
Rena XR transforms complex EEG data into dynamic, interactive 3D brain models during neuroscience experiments. This advanced visualization not only synchronizes and displays real-time neural activity from multiple electrodes but also integrates data from other imaging modalities like fMRI and MEG. By allowing researchers to rotate, zoom, and slice the 3D model, Rena XR provides insights into neural patterns and spatial relationships that are not easily discernible from traditional 2D maps or raw EEG traces, offering a comprehensive view of brain function.

Real-Time Data Dynamics and Analytics
In the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Rena XR revolutionizes research by offering real-time data dynamics and customizable analytics. This platform enables researchers to apply advanced filters and analytics to complex, multimodal interaction data, effectively isolating relevant features and removing noise. The ability to adjust analysis strategies on the fly allows researchers to rapidly test hypotheses and explore intricate data interactions, such as eye tracking and facial expressions, enhancing discovery and driving significant breakthroughs in HCI.
